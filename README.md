## Google Classroom Overview
Google Classroom is a virtual classroom used to share class materials, exchange notes, and submit work. Here's how to navigate it:

- **Login:** Use your school email and the class code provided to login.
- **Stream:** This is the first page you see when you login to Classroom. Your "Do Now" and Lesson slides will be posted at the top at the start of class.
- **Assignments & Classwork tab:** All resources and assignments will be found in the Classwork tab. The "View your work" button will show every assignment and its status.
- **CN Reference Table:** At the top of the Classwork tab, you'll find the Code Nation Reference Table. This is a great place to look for examples if you get stuck during an assignment.

## Do Now & GitHub

Next, we'll be setting up a GitHub account, a platform used by developers to share and work on code. It'll be an essential tool for your journey in Code Nation.

Once your account is set up, we'll be jumping into our first collaborative coding exercise where we write a simple poem together. We'll also answer some web-related questions, such as:

1. How many people use the Internet every day?
2. What is the definition of web development?
3. What percentage of software engineers are female?

## Coding Practice

We'll focus on practicing coding based on what we've learned so far. This is a time for you to ask questions, practice, and learn from your peers.

## Sharing & Shout Outs

We'll share our work and give shout outs to those who have made great strides during the session.
